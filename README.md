# S_and_P

This program looks at the price perfromance of securities after a one day change in the stock price.  There are several interesting observations that were make from running the program:  

1.  In a bull market, the price performance of a stock after a significant price drop(i.e. greater than 5%), was significantly higher than the return for the market in general.  

2.  In a bear market, significant price drops did not lead to a better price performance over the next several days in comparison to the broader averages.
